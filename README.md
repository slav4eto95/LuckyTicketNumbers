# Lucky Ticket Numbers
Program that prints all lucky ticket numbers between given range.

Every bus ticket (in Bulgaria) has a unique 5-digit number (from 00000 to 99999). We will call a lucky ticket one in which the sum of the first two digits is equal to the sum of the last two and is also equal to the third. For example, 34752 is a lucky ticket because 3 + 4 = 7 = 5 + 2.
